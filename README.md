# python_StreetListConverter

Recieved a text file from our transportation system with a list of addresses and valid even/odd house numbers linked to a specific building in our school district

The goal was a function to take that text file and output a text file with each unique address that links to the school in question.

Information will be imported into our SIS for data analysis purposes.
